DynamicBadgeCreator
===================

Dynamic Badge Creator (DBC) is a console based PHP application built in an object oriented fashion to support the creation of participant badges for a gathering. It assumes that the dynamic information to be provided in each database resides in a database and also allows the insertion of a common logo in all the badges.
